                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello and thank you for visiting my portfolio! My name is Francisco Ruiz, but all of my friends
                    call me Frank. I am the third of four siblings(two sisters and a younger brother).  Like many, my
                    parents migrated to the Untied States at a young age in order to make a better life for what
                    would soon become a family of six. Thanks to them, the characteristics, and values instilled in
                    me; I have been able to become part of the first generation to earn a college education.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>I am enrolled in this class because I think its a great opportunity. I started coding in April of
                    2015 and have a desire to learn as much of it as possible. After building a pretty good
                    understanding of the basics I started researching coding boot camps in the area and chose to go
                    with Learning Fuze after meeting with Fabian and Bill.  I am looking forward to refining my
                    skills and becoming an effective programmer.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>I would like to land a job as a jr. developer, preferably on the front end. I would like this
                    role because I feel programming would keep me more engaged in my work then things I have done in
                    the past. I would like to always be learing new things and growing professionally. As
                    Napoleon Hill put it:
                    <blockquote>If your not learning while your earning, your cheating yourself out of the better portion
                        of your compensation.</blockquote></p>
